### WHAT is unit test?

<ins>Definition</ins>
  
Unit test is the software development technique. We'll devide the application into isolated unit for testing!

<ins>Purpose</ins>

Make sure that each isolated unit (function, method...) works correctly as we expected

### WHY need unit test?

- Code feels simple from the start
- BUT it doesn't stay simple forever
- it WILL be updated and grows into multiple cases
- Our brain can't remember all cases after long time (brain overwheled)

So **unit test** is help us list all cases need to be test in Application's Requirement.
We can cover all cases that we have and make sure our functions still work well after updated!

<ins>Benefits</ins>
- Save time for development, grow faster!
- Save cost for organizations, companies
- Avoid **breaking changes** in code

### Note when WRITE an unit test

You should read about Test Drivent Development (TDD)
